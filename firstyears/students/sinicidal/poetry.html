The blood came out and I can remember him screaming up the steep driveway beside our old miners cottage. I didnt really understand what was happening. Afterwards my parents killed the dog but I was convinced (by mum) that "Pirate" had gone to live on a farm. At the age of 16, Dad told me; this wasn't the case.</i></bdo>
