<p style="text-align: center;">The images below are an exploration of the program Processing and the theme of Truth.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">Truth can mean different things to different people, and the use of different colours is symbolic of the different perceptions of the same truth people may have.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">Different versions of the same truth can be as a result of our attitude and values, life experiences as well as our place in the world.</p>
